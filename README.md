# ActivityMonitor

This project is to build an application that will allow parents to monitor their children's online, text messaging, facebook and 
other apps that can have messages and images shared. The Idea would be to use Machine Learning either on the local device or in 
the cloud to review the information and determine if it is inappropriate. If it is flagged as inappropriate, then an email and 
the message is sent to the parents to alert them. If it is not inappropriate the data is not stored. This is trying to preserve 
privacy for the child as much as possible, but allow the parents to set some boundaries that will alert them if they are triggered.

This will be two apps with a cloud backend for processing information. There will be a client app that would be installed in the 
child's device. This app will basically run in the background collecting information. The second app will be an admin app that 
would run on the parent's phone that will allow them to monitor the child.
